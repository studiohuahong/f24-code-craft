Instructor: Hong Hua

Section: A

Parsons First Year, Parsons School of Design, The New School

This course is an introduction to creative coding and the use of tools like p5.js and the program Processing to generate interactive objects and experiences. Projects and sketches will explore the use of code to generate and manipulate image, sound, and light, and will provide an introduction to the open-source prototyping platform Arduino that can be used to create interactive electronic objects. Students explore how coding differs from other forms of making through hands-on experimentation, readings, videos, and examples of interactive projects, and have discussions about the ways that interactivity impacts our experience in the world. There is no coding knowledge required, and students who have some experience already will have opportunities to build on their knowledge.
